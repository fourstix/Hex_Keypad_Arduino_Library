  This example prints which button was pressed. Press * for space and # for new line.

  Qwiic KeyPad records any button presses to a stack. It can remember up to 15 buttone presses.
  The master I2C device (for example, an Uno) can ask for the oldest button pressed.
  If the master continues to read in button presses, it will receive the entire stack (from oldest to newest).
  This is handy if you need to go and do something else with your code, you can then come back to the
  keypad and pull in the last 15 button presses.
